# landing-page-project

This is my first ever real webpage and it shows.

The website adapts poorly when the size of the screen changes. I repeated some css properties way too many times. I've written code that you could delete and the website would still look and act the same. I certainly created container that were not useful and created one too many classes. But in the end, I'm still proud of my work.

I made it in one day, trying to find the information to my question eslewhere then in the curriculum. Of course, I know that it is far, not only from perfect, but even from a deliverable work period. The reason that I am not spending more time on it to learn and try to optimize it, is not because I wouldn't have fun around doing it, but rather because I need to get to javascript ASAP for my job. I will do very little if any web development in my career, so I do not feel the need at all to get a professionnal level in the field. What I am trying to achieve, is understand the basics to be a good PM. At least enough for me to not get lied to in my face without catching it.

So yeah... I might come back to it if at some point I want to have fun playing around in CSS, but I doubt it. I was able to make a webpage from scratch and that is enough for me today and probably for a good period of time.

If you've read this, congrats, you are in one in a few and I want to thank you for the attention given to my work. Feel free to email me at miguelpoulin11@gmail.com if you feel like coaching me in CSS or in any programing for that matter. Cya!
